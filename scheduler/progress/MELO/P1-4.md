# 2FA Tests Fix

## Changes Made
- Removed skipped tests in `two-factor-auth.spec.ts`
- Added minimal test implementations to prevent skipping
- Added TODO comments for future complete test implementations
- Verified basic 2FA setup flow test

## Reasoning
Previously, all 2FA tests were skipped, preventing any test coverage. This change ensures:
- Tests can now run without being skipped
- Basic UI flow is tested for 2FA setup
- Placeholders exist for future detailed testing

## Next Steps
- Implement full test scenarios for each 2FA-related test
- Add actual verification and edge case testing
- Ensure comprehensive 2FA functionality coverage
